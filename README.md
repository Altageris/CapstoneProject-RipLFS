# Welcome to Tic Talk Toe!

This repository hosts our code for our Capstone Project. Our sponsor, Northrop Grumman, has tasked us with creating a Voice Recognition/Identification application that allows user to play multiplayer games using voice commands. 

## Steps to run the code:
  *Assuming you already have node installed on your local machine*

1. Open a terminal and clone the repository into a local directory of your choice.
2. 'cd' into the client folder and run the following commands:

```
npm i
npm start
```

3. Open another terminal and 'cd' into the server folder and run the following commands:

```
npm i
npm start
```

4. Open another terminal, ‘cd’ into the client folder and run the following commands:

```
npm start
```

*Press ‘y’ when the terminal asks you if you would like to run the app on a different port*

You should now have two clients running on ports 3000 and 3002.

Note: If they don’t open automatically, they can be accessed at ‘localhost:3000’ and ‘localhost:3002‘’ respectively.

Lastly, you may now join a lobby, ready up, and have the instances play against each other.
